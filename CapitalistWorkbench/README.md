Version 1.0
    Implemented Features:
    - JFrame has all the nesessary buttons and panels
    
Need to Implement:
    - Use the Amazon API to fill my AmazonProduct class (Without knowing how to do this yet, I didnt want to make the class because I dont know if what I make now will be compatible when I do end up learning how to pull down that product data, I dont even know if my setup of classes will be the most efficient)
   
   Current Status... Currently nothing is runnable. Originally I planned to scrape Amazon's website to get my product data, but that did not end up working. As of now I have not figured out how to use the Amazon API because of its many services. I also have no experience using and implementing APIs of any kind. So what I have done is make the JFrame that I will use to display the information. That way when I figure out how to use the API all I will have to do is make a class to store that data, put that class into a panel, and put the panel into my already made JFrame. Because it is the week before finals, I will have lots more freetime because we do not have volleyball practice or workouts. I feel that I will have it done by the end of the week.
